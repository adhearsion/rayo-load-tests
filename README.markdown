# Rayo Load Tests

This auxiliar project contains the framework that we use to perform load testing on Rayo. It basically launches a Prism instance and uses JMeter to throw load at it. Instead of creating ad-hoc performance tests we use actual functional tests which reflect real life scenarios. This gives us a more accurate image about the scalability for our servers. 

The framework is based on JMeter.
